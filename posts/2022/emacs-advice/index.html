Advising is similar to hooks in the sense that it allows us to extend a particular function. Hooks usually get the job done, but sometimes they cannot be used because either the maintainer just didn&rsquo;t add them to their mode, or because they don&rsquo;t run in the place you need them.">

      <p>I&rsquo;m not an Emacs poweruser by any means, but after using it for ~10 years I am at least aware of many of its capabilities. And yet, today I learned something new: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">Advice</a>.</p>
<p>Advising is similar to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html">hooks</a> in the sense that it allows us to extend a particular function. Hooks usually get the job done, but sometimes they cannot be used because either the maintainer just didn&rsquo;t add them to their mode, or because they don&rsquo;t run in the place you need them. This is where <em>Advice</em> come handy.</p>
<p>Advising a function allows us to execute custom code <em>before</em>, <em>after</em>, or <em>surrounding</em> the function. Any function. And this makes them really powerful.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;m starting to use <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal">org-journal</a> after a stint with org-roam, logseq, and obsidian, by that order (this in itself deserves its own post). One thing I like about logseq and obsidian is that they allow to easily add templates to your notes. In particular, I have a template set for my daily notes, as they always follow the same structure. Alas, there&rsquo;s no easy way to do it in org-journal.</p>
<p>Luckily (I thought), <code>org-journal-new-entry</code> provides a hook. Surely I will be able to use that! Well, not so fast. Because of <em>reasons</em> my template was inserted correctly, but the date was added <strong>after</strong> the rest of the fields. After an hour of debugging I couldn&rsquo;t for the life of me figure out why that was happening. What I did notice was that the hook <code>org-journal-after-entry-create-hook</code> wasn&rsquo;t called exactly at the end of the function, but somewhere in the middle. So some elisp magic was happening between the hook and the end result.</p>
<p>Right when I was starting to modify the package code to suit my functionality, I stumbled upon Advice. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I needed in this case! I absolutely want to run my piece of code to insert a template after <code>org-journal-new-entry</code> has finished running:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  (defun dani/insert-journal-template (&amp;rest r)
    (when (not (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))
      (save-excursion
        (insert
         (concat &#34;\n** ‚úÖ To Do Today [/]\n&#34;
                 &#34;- [ ]\n&#34;
                 &#34;- [ ]\n&#34;
                 &#34;- [ ]\n&#34;
                 &#34;- [ ]\n&#34;
                 &#34;- [ ]\n&#34;
                 &#34;** üìù Notes\n&#34;
                 &#34;** üìì Interstitial Journal\n&#34;
                 &#34;** ‚ö° Outcomes\n&#34;
                 &#34;*** Summary\n&#34;
                 &#34;*** Artifacts\n&#34;)))))

  (advice-add &#39;org-journal-new-entry :after #dani/insert-journal-template)
</code></pre><p>The advising function (<code>dani/insert-journal-template</code>) takes the same arguments as the advised function (<code>org-journal-new-entry</code>). Since I really don&rsquo;t care about the arguments, I capture them with <code>&amp;rest</code>, which puts them in a list, <code>r</code>, where they are never used.</p>
