      <p>The ISS (International Space Station) has a radio and its crew sometimes  uses to communicate with amateur radio operators and also, from time to time, to send images back to Earth!</p>
<p>The format they use is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television">SSTV (Slow Scan television)</a>, in particular its format PD120. It takes around 2 minutes to receive a full image. And you can receive this images yourself by using a small handheld radio.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h2>
<p>This is the image I was able to capture. Not to bad for something hundreds of kilometers away!</p>
<p><img src="/img/2019/ISS12292019_1044_5.jpg" alt="SSTV"></p>
<p>The downlink of the ISS is located at <em>145.800 MHz</em>. I used a web to check when a pass nearby my location would happen. You are going to get a better signal if the max altitude is larger than 10°. Also, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s visible or not, since we are not interested in seeing it with our naked eye.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.n2yo.com">www.n2yo.com</a>, but there are plenty of pages and apps with this information.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the path I used, from another app called SatSat:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2019/ISS_PATH.jpg" alt="ISS Path"></p>
<p>I set the squelch of my Baofeng to 0, and then at the AOS time I started recording with my iPhone voice memos app. I had to move around to try to find the best orientation of the antenna, but eventually I found the transmission noise (you can see how it sounds and check that your SSTV decoding app works <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG4UhlByFyw">in this video</a>).</p>
<p>Then I simply came back to my car, played the recording back to my MacBook runnin <a href="https://www.qsl.net/kd6cji/">MultiScan 3B</a>, and this image was decoded.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say this is the bare minimum. You can also try to input the radio audio directlly into your computer, or phone, but I didn&rsquo;t have the connectros needed to do this.</p>
<p>Transmissions will continue until Jan 1st 18:20 UTC.</p>
