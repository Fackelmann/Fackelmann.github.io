      <description>When I first learned Object Oriented Programming (OOP) a few years ago the book I was reading had a strange obsession with cars.
Imagine you have a car, it said. A car is composed of a body, four tires, and an engine. Furthermore, you can have a Ferrari, which is a specific type of car, or you could build cars with different types of wheels. This is the way it explained the concepts of Polymorfism, Inheritance, Composition, and Instantiation.</description>

      <description>How would you shuffle a deck of cards? A couple of weeks ago I was talking to a friend about the problem of shuffling a deck of cards. His take on it was to do:
for i = 1 to n do a[i] = i for i = 1 to n-1 do swap[a[i],a[Random[i,n]] My idea was:
for i = 1 to n do a[i] = i for i = n to 1 do swap[a[i],a[random[1,i]] Both of them seemed reasonable, but were any of them correct?</description>
