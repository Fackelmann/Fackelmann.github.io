      <description>Lately I have become increasingly worried about the problem of link rot. Gwern has an excellent article on it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Pinboard for more than 5 years, and I have over 1200 bookmarks, so out of curiosity I decided to check how many of these links were dead. The result was that more than 5% of the links didn&amp;rsquo;t exist any more, or redirected to a 403 page. Since I have been continously adding bookmarks over this time, this means that the link rot rate is (significantly) larger than 5% per 5 years.</description>
