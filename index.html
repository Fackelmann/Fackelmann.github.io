<p>The ISS (International Space Station) has a radio and its crew sometimes  uses to communicate with amateur radio operators and also, from time to time, to send images back to Earth!</p>
<p>The format they use is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television">SSTV (Slow Scan television)</a>, in particular its format PD120. It takes around 2 minutes to receive a full image. And you can receive this images yourself by using a small handheld radio.</p>
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<p>This is the image I was able to capture. Not to bad for something hundreds of kilometers away!</p>
<p><a href="/scrivings/receiving-images-from-the-iss/ISS12292019_1044_5.jpg"><img alt="SSTV" src="/scrivings/receiving-images-from-the-iss/ISS12292019_1044_5.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The downlink of the ISS is located at <em>145.800 MHz</em>. I used a web to check when a pass nearby my location would happen. You are going to get a better signal if the max altitude is larger than 10°. Also, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s visible or not, since we are not interested in seeing it with our naked eye.</p>
<p>I used www.n2yo.com, but there are plenty of pages and apps with this information.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the path I used, from another app called SatSat:</p>
<p><a href="/scrivings/receiving-images-from-the-iss/ISS_PATH.jpg"><img alt="ISS Path" src="/scrivings/receiving-images-from-the-iss/ISS_PATH.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I set the squelch of my Baofeng to 0, and then at the AOS time I started recording with my iPhone voice memos app. I had to move around to try to find the best orientation of the antenna, but eventually I found the transmission noise (you can see how it sounds and check that your SSTV decoding app works <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG4UhlByFyw">in this video</a>).</p>
<p>Then I simply came back to my car, played the recording back to my MacBook runnin <a href="https://www.qsl.net/kd6cji/">MultiScan 3B</a>, and this image was decoded.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say this is the bare minimum. You can also try to input the radio audio directlly into your computer, or phone, but I didn&rsquo;t have the connectros needed to do this.</p>
<p>Transmissions will continue until Jan 1st 18:20 UTC.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I discovered somewhat serendipitously the book &ldquo;Measurement&rdquo; by Paul Lockhart. Even though I haven&rsquo;t finished it yet I want to share some of my thoughts on this excellent book.</p>
<p><a href="/scrivings/measurement-by-paul-lockhart-a-review/measurement.jpg"><img alt="measurement" src="/scrivings/measurement-by-paul-lockhart-a-review/measurement.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>The Joy of Mathematics</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever taken a maths class (high school or undergrad level), the way it&rsquo;s usually thought is &ldquo;Here is this theorem, here is the proof on why it&rsquo;s true. Here you have some exercises to apply this new theorem&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This approach can be fine, and you might have ended up liking mathematics despite it. But it&rsquo;s missing a sense of wonder, of organic growth. Why did someone decide to prove that particular theorem? What problems was he trying to solve? How did he come up with that, and how did he work on writing a proof? We usually study the start, and the end, but nothing in the middle, or what brought us to that start in the first place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Paul Lockhart is trying to convey in his book.</p>
<p>For example, on the first few pages we see the following idea. Draw some triangles. Join each vertex with the midpoint of the oposite side. It seems that those three segments <em>always</em> meet at one point, for every triangle. Is that the case? Why? What&rsquo;s the distance from vertex to intersection point, and from intersection point to side?</p>
<p><a href="/scrivings/measurement-by-paul-lockhart-a-review/triangle.png"><img alt="triangle" src="/scrivings/measurement-by-paul-lockhart-a-review/triangle.png"></a></p>
<p>You probably recall from your elementary math classes that this point is called barycenter, and you might also recall that the distance AP is 2/3 of AA&rsquo;, and PA&rsquo; is 1/3 of AA&rsquo;. The thing is, I was taught this as a fact. I was never impressed by why these lines always intersect at one point (instead of three), or thought too much about it.</p>
<p>Paul Lockhart tries to share this sense of wonder with you, and in doing so he doesn&rsquo;t provide any answers, only questions. And it&rsquo;s on you to work on them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slowly advancing through the book. Reading some pages, thinking about the problems, coming up with new questions, advancing&hellip;You are not going to learn complex calculus from this book, but soo far it&rsquo;s been a very fun journey for me. I recommend it.</p>

<h2>How would you shuffle a deck of cards?</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was talking to a friend about the problem of shuffling a deck of cards. His take on it was to do:</p>
<h3>Shuffle 1</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="n">swap</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Random</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>My idea was:</p>
<h3>Shuffle 2</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="n">swap</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Both of them seemed reasonable, but were any of them correct?</p>
<p>And what does it mean for the shuffling implementation to be correct? It means that each of the possible permutations of the array (or deck) is equally likely. Which is equivalent to the problem of generating a random permutation of a given array.</p>
<p>This week I was flipping through Skiena&rsquo;s &ldquo;The algorithm design manual&rdquo; and landed in section 14.4 &ldquo;Generating permutations&rdquo;, and ended up spending my weekend researching this subject.</p>
<h2>Permutations</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously the problem of shuffling a deck of cards (or an array of distinct elements for that matter) is equivalent to generating a random permutation. A standard playing card deck has 52 cards, and hence 52! possible deck arrangements. After shuffling we want to make sure every one of those possible 52! outputs is equally likely.</p>
<h2>How to do this?</h2>
<p>For small arrays it is feasible (but not trivial) to generate all possible permutations and then randomly select one of them and return it as the output. The problem is that permutations order of growth is factorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>For 4 cards we have 4! = 24 possible outputs</li>
<li>For 6 cards we have 6! = 720 possible outputs</li>
<li>For 8 cards we have 8! = 40320 possible outputs</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
<li>For 52 cards we have 52! = ~8.06e67 possible outputs</li>
</ul>
<p>So this approach becomes unreasonable very quickly (factorially so!). There must be a better way.</p>
<h2>On rank</h2>
<p>A quick side-note, as I will be using this in my analysis. The rank of a particular permutation is its position in a given <em>lexicographic</em> generation order. The lexicographic order is the sequence in which the different permutations would appear if they were sorted numerically [1].</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to understand with an example. Let&rsquo;s say we have 3 elements: {1,2,3}. The lexicographic order for its permutations is:</p>
<p>{1,2,3} -&gt; {1,3,2} -&gt; {2,1,3} -&gt; {2,3,1} -&gt; {3,1,2} -&gt; {3,2,1}</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>{1,2,3} will have rank 1</li>
<li>{2,3,1} will have rank 4</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experiments I will be calculating the rank of every permutation generated. A good shuffling algorithm will generate permutations whose rank is given by a uniform distribution, this is, every rank is equally likely.</p>
<p>Skiena provides a recursive implementation for rank calculation in [1], but I ended up using the simpler implementation explained in [2]</p>
<h2>Shuffling in memory</h2>
<p>A better way to do this is to do something similar to what we do in &ldquo;Shuffle 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shuffle 2&rdquo;, this is, randomly swap element of the array. As I said those 2 algorithms seem reasonable, so let me throw another one into the mix:</p>
<h3>Shuffle 3</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">do</span> <span class="n">swap</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Random</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Reasonable enough as well, right? So let&rsquo;s put these 3 algorithms to test. </p>
<p>For every shuffling algorithm I will have an unordered deck of cards ({1,2,3,4}) that I will shuffle and store the rank. I will do this 100k times and I will keep track of how many times each rank has appeared for every algorithm.</p>
<p>If the algorithms provide real random permutations we would expect to see each rank to be equally likely.</p>

<p>We observe that both Shuffle 1 and Shuffle 2 provide a uniform distribution of every possible permutation. But Shuffle 3 is definitely favoring some permutations over others. What is happening here?</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put all 3 together here for easier reference.</p>

<p>As we can see the variations are minimal.</p>
<p>In <em>Shuffle 1</em> we traverse through the array. At every point we find a random index between the current index and the end of the array, and swap the current element with the element in the random index.</p>
<p>In <em>Shuffle 2</em> we traverse through the array in reversed order. At every point we find a random index between the beginning of the array and the current index, and swap the current element with the element in the random index.</p>
<p>We can already see these 2 implementations are equivalent.</p>
<p>In <em>Shuffle 3</em> we swap the current element with a random element selected from the <em>whole</em> array. Strangely, this solution seems more random since each element can be swapped multiple times. But we already see that it won&rsquo;t provide a truly random permutation. Why? And why do <em>Shuffle 1</em> and <em>Shuffle 2</em> work?</p>
<p>Jeff Atwood explains it beautifully in his article &ldquo;The danger of naivete&rdquo; [3].</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a 3 card deck. Shuffle 3 will do 3 shuffles: rand(3), rand(3), and rand(3). For a total of 3^3=27 possible outputs. Strange, since in 3 cards we only have 3! = 6 possible permutations. On the other hand shuffles 1 and 2 will do 2 shuffles: rand(3) and rand(2), for a total of 3*2 = 6 possible outputs. So far what we would expect!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what the outputs for Shuffling 3 are:</p>

<a href="/scrivings/on-shuffling-and-permutations/shuffling_tree.png"><img alt="shuffling tree" src="/scrivings/on-shuffling-and-permutations/shuffling_tree.png"></a></p>
<p>If we count each occurrence we have:
<a href="/scrivings/on-shuffling-and-permutations/permutation_count.png"><img alt="permutation count" src="/scrivings/on-shuffling-and-permutations/permutation_count.png"></a></p>
<p>So we see clearly that with &ldquo;Shuffle 3&rdquo; each possible output won&rsquo;t be equally likely. Therefore, this is not a suitable algorithm to shuffle or generate random permutations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shuffle 2&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shuffle 3&rdquo; are an implementation of what is known as Fisher-Yates[4] or Knuth (Algorithm P)[5] Shuffle.</p>
<p>Originally developed as a manual method in the 30&rsquo;s by Fisher and Yates, with time complexity O(n^2). The above implementations reduce it&rsquo;s complexity to O(n), by swapping the selected elements and reducing the random index range at every iteration.</p>
<p>Doing a similar analysis as the one showed above would yield the following possible outputs, each one with a count of 1:</p>
<p>{1,2,3},{1,3,2},{2,1,3},{2,3,1},{3,1,2},{3,2,1}</p>
<p>Which is exactly what we want from a random shuffle.</p>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>We have seen that minimal changes in the implementation of an algorithm can yield results with undesirable random properties. The difference is subtle, easy to miss, and it&rsquo;s not evident which implementations are correct and which are not. It&rsquo;s better to stick with standard libraries when dealing with problems that require truly random results.</p>
